Tic Tac Toe Project

- This is my first ever completed development project.

- Technologies Used: Javasctipt, HTML5, CSS, Flexbox, JQuery, AJAX

- The purpose of this project was to create a fully functioning, classic tic tac toe game with authentication and functioning API.  This was a challenging process for me, I plan to continue working on this project, and commit more updates regularly.

- My next focus will be to organize the Login, Reset, and New Game buttons to create a less awkward look to the page and also do some general modifications to the CSS in order to make this an more stylish game to interact with.  I also plan to clean up the JS code, this being my first project left the organization of the game logic a bit clunky.

- User stories:
  - As a user, I want to be able to click a square on the game board.
  - As a user I want to be able to change back and forth betwen X's turn and O's turn appropriately throughout the game.
  - As a user I want to be able to see which character wins each game, or if it is a tie.
  - As a user I want to be able to sign up, sign in, and sign out with user authentication.
